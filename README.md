# image-denoising
- This is an implementation of image denoising algorithm using HTHP method on matlab.
- The type of noise treated by this algorithm is salt and pepper noise. 
- To run this code please run the main_final.m file after placing all the files in the current directory on matlab. 
- You can try your own image by replacing it with the example image provided in this code by:
-                1. place your image in the current directory

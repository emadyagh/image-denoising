# image-denoising
- This is an implementation of image denoising algorithm using HTHP method on matlab. (paper: A new family of hybrid three-term conjugate gradient method for
unconstrained optimization with application to image restoration and portfolio selection by: 
Maulana Malik1,*, Ibrahim Mohammed Sulaiman2, Auwal Bala Abubakar3,4 , Gianinna Ardaneswari1 and Sukono5) 
- The type of noise treated by this algorithm is salt and pepper noise. 
- To run this code please run the main_final.m file after placing all the files in the current directory on matlab. 
- You can try your own image by replacing it with the example image provided in this code by:
-                1. place your image in the current directory
-                2. replace the link to your image with the existing image link in the imread instruction of the main_final.m file
